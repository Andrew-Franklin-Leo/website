# Meaning Continuity Program™

**Anti-Nihilism Infrastructure**

Automation fails last at the level of meaning, not mechanics.

## What Breaks Without It
* Nihilism
* Leaders don't survive collapse
* Humans sidelined

## What This Instrument Enforces
* Post-Failure Recovery
* Meaning Preservation
* Human Centrality Continuity

## Sovereign Activation
Activated only when scale exceeds human legibility thresholds.
