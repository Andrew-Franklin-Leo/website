Frankmax Cyber Security is not a firewall; it is a **Border**. We treat digital space as sovereign territory. Entry is not a right; it is a privilege granted only after rigorous verification.

Our architecture assumes a hostile environment (Zero Trust) and enforces absolute perimeter control against state-level actors.
