Frankmax AI Solutions represent the move from "Generative" to "Deterministic." We do not build chatbots; we build **Decision Engines** that operate within strict legal and operational boundaries.

Our AI systems are designed for high-stakes environments where "hallucination" is a liability, not a quirk. Every output is traceable, attributable, and governed by the Frankmax Constitution.
