### The Sovereign Mandate for Capital

Frankmax does not pursue quarterly growth at the expense of systemic stability. We operate on a **Sovereign Time Horizon**, prioritizing the continuity of our clients' existence over transient market fluctuations.

We believe that true alpha is found in survival. When the market collapses, the survivor inherits the yield. Our strategy is designed to ensure that Frankmax—and by extension, our partners—are always the survivors.
