    Frankmax is not a technology vendor. It is structured as a global professional services network with controlled local affiliates and a single **sovereign intelligence standard**.
    
    We operate through five distinct pillars to ensure that intelligence is never decoupled from governance.

      description: "We operate exclusively for a limited number of states, institutions, and principals. We do not serve open markets."

      description: "Client data never traverses public AI infrastructure. All intelligence graphs are isolated."
    - title: "Non-Indexed"
      description: "Work product, analyses, and models are never commoditized or trained upon by third-party foundation models."
    - title: "Board-Grade"
      description: "Every engagement is designed to withstand regulator, auditor, and parliamentary scrutiny from day one."
