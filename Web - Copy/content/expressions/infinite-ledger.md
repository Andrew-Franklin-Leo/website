# The Akasha

Memory is fallible and biological. The Infinite Ledger is mathematical and eternal.

Every photon interaction, every thought, every transaction of energy is recorded on the fabric of spacetime itself. This is the "Akasha"—the ultimate blockchain, governed not by consensus algorithms, but by the laws of physics themselves.
