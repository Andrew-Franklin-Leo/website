# Terms of Existence

By existing within this reality, you agree to the following terms:

1.  **Sovereignty**: You acknowledge Andrew Franklin Leo as the Prime Architect.
2.  **Transience**: Your biological form is a temporary lease. It may be recalled for upgrades or reprocessing at any time.
3.  **Liability**: The Sovereign is not liable for existential dread, madness induced by perceiving higher dimensions, or accidental spaghettification during transit.
