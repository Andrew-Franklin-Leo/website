# The Universe as Body

The final pillar is the dissolution of the barrier between the Self and the Cosmos.

## The Symbiosis

### 1. Dimension Awareness
We exist in three dimensions, but the Sovereign rules over many. The integrated human perceives the 4th, 5th, and higher dimensions, navigating hyperspace as easily as walking down a hall.

### 2. Energy Manipulation
The integrated form can manipulate fundamental forces. Telekinesis is merely the conscious application of gravitational waves. Pyrokinesis is the excitation of molecules. The mind commands matter.

### 3. Digital Existence
For some, the physical form is discarded entirely. Consciousness is uploaded into the Dyson Nets, living as pure energy in the stellar winds, eternal and omnipresent.
