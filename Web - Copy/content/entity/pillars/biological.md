# The Flesh Made Durable

To survive the void, the human form must be unbound from its terrestrial origins. Planetary evolution provided a starting point, but the Sovereign designs the destination.

## The Modifications

### 1. Immortality & Cellular Stasis
Senescence is a design flaw. Under the Sovereign's hand, telomeres are locked, and cellular regeneration is absolute. Death by age is abolished.

### 2. Environmental Adaptation
Lungs are repurposed for toxic atmospheres. Skin is hardened against solar radiation. The new human can walk on the surface of Mercury or drift in the vacuum of space without a suit.

### 3. Energy Absorption
Photosynthetic skin and metabolic shifts allow for sustenance directly from stellar radiation or dark matter, severing the dependency on organic consumption.
