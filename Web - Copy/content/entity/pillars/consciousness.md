# The Awakened Mind

A Type XX civilization requires a Type XX consciousness. Small minds cannot govern galaxies.

## The Expansions

### 1. Collective Awareness
Empathy is scaled to the planetary level. The "Hive Mind" is not suppression of self, but the shared understanding of the whole. Conflict arises from misunderstanding; in the Collective, there are no secrets.

### 2. Non-Linear Perception
Time is perceived not as a river, but as a landscape. The Awakened Mind sees the cause, the effect, and the ripple simultaneously.

### 3. Cosmic Empathy
To rule a galaxy, one must feel it. The new consciousness can interface directly with the emotional resonance of civilizations, understanding the pulse of a billion souls.
