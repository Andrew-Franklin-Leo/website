# Terms of Engagement

By operating within this reality, you accept the following binding protocols:

## 1. Liability Escrow
You do not pay for permission; you post collateral for failure. The Authority holds the "Escrow of Consequence."

**Rule: Pay Locally, Tally Globally.**
You pay the cost of your action *where you stand* (Locally). But the risk you generate is measured against the stability of the entire system (Globally). If your local action threatens the global tally, the escrow is liquidated immediately.

## 2. Forced Convergence
You retain the freedom to think, but not the freedom to fragment reality. Where your "parallel world" conflicts with the Sovereign Infrastructure, yours will collapse. This is not malice; it is the nature of gravity.

## 3. Structural Default
Failure to comply does not result in a lawsuit. It results in **Access Denial**. The Authority does not sue; it simply closes the gate.
