# The Logic of Permission

In a governed system, physics is not enough. "Can" does not imply "May."

## 1. Permission to Act
Action without authorization is indistinguishable from attack. The Authority binds the "Permission to Act" to specific, revocable keys. If you do not hold the key, your action is not just illegal; it is structurally impossible.

## 2. Time Asymmetry
Authority is not perpetual. It degrades. Every permission issued within this domain has a half-life. Renewal is not automatic; it is a re-evaluation of necessity.

## 3. The Stop Command
The ultimate compliance mechanism is the **Kill Switch**. If a system cannot be stopped instantly by the Governance Organism, it is classified as a threat and neutralized. The Authority does not negotiate with momentum.
