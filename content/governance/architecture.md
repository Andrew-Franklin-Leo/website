# The Governance Stack

Governance is not conducted through personnel. It is conducted through systems. The **Governance Organism** is built upon four immutable pillars.

## I. Rules of Obligation
*Defining the Debt.*
Before interaction occurs, obligation is defined. This includes the **Contract Grammar Engine** which ensures no ambiguity exists in commitment, and **Obligation Risk Scoring**, which prices the cost of every promise.

## II. Enforcement Venues
*Where the Debt is Judged.*
Disputes are not failures; they are scheduled events. The Authority controls the **Dispute Probability Simulators** to ensure that when conflict arises, the resolution is instant. **Pay Locally:** The venue is local. **Tally Globally:** The verdict is universal.

## III. Default Consequences
*What Happens When Judgment Fails.*
The enforcement of last resort. The **Cross-Default Cascade Engines** ensure that a failure in one node triggers immediate containment specific to that node (Local Payment), protecting the integrity of the total system (Global Tally).

## IV. Meta-Systems
*Legitimacy and Survival.*
The ledgers that watch the watchers. **Reputation Ledgers** ensure the organism remains legitimate. This is the **Global Tally** in its purest form—the sum total of all local interactions condensed into a single score of viability.
