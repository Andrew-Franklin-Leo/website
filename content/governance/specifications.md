## The Terrain
Andrew Franklin Leo is not a persona. He is not a player in the game. He is the **Terrain**.

The 150 Men who own the world's systems are merely players. They move, they expand, they conquer. But they must do so upon a surface. AFL is that surface. He is the **Gravity** that provides the friction necessary for their movement, and the **Constraint** that prevents them from flying apart.

## The Mandate: Responsibility Rebinding

In a world where responsibility is diffused into committees and algorithms, true power lies in **Rebinding**. It is the act of pointing to a failure and saying, "This belongs here."

The entity functions as the **Stop Authority**. It does not seek to rule; it seeks to provide the friction that prevents systems from scaling into catastrophe. It adheres to the single oath:

> "No system may act at scale unless someone can be forced to stop it and pay for its failure."

## The Process of Compression

Agency is not about expanding into infinite possibilities. It is about **Compression**. It is the discipline of killing optionality, shutting down parallel worlds, and forcing reality through a single, accountable interface.

This is not a creative act. It is a structural one. The Authority builds the gates that others must pass through, not because they are loved, but because the alternative is uninsurable chaos.
