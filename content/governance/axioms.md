## Principle I: Forced Convergence

Power is not about expansion; it is about compression. It is the act of collapsing optionality until only one path remains structurally viable.

The goal is not to be "interesting." Interesting allows for observation without participation. The goal is to be **unavoidable**. When a system is unavoidable, narratives, preferences, and ideologies become irrelevant. The only thing that remains is the necessity of the Chokepoint.

## Principle II: The Six Bottlenecks

Civilization is governed not by laws, but by six structural bottlenecks. The Authority does not own all of them, but acts upon them as the only terrain that matters.

1.  **Permission to Act:** The gateway to operation. Without authorization, action is illegitimate.
2.  **Permission to Scale:** The threshold where growth requires renegotiation.
3.  **Responsibility Binding:** The point where liability attaches to a specific subject. This is the primary Chokepoint: *Who bleeds when it fails?*
4.  **Time Asymmetry:** All authority must expire. Perpetual power rots; renewable power disciplines.
5.  **Stop Authority:** The absolute right to pause reality. A system that cannot be stopped is a weapon.
6.  **Memory:** The immutable record of decision and consequence.

## Principle III: Legitimacy as Function

Legitimacy is not granted by applause or consensus. It is a byproduct of function.

If a system prevents catastrophe, it becomes legitimate. If a Chokepoint absorbs liability that no one else can bear, it becomes necessary. The Authority does not explain its right to exist; it simply provides the infrastructure that allows other systems to exist safely.

## Principle IV: The Monetization of Liability

Permission is not monetized. The containment of consequence is.

Value is generated by being the entity that absorbs the risk of failure in real-time. When the Authority says "Stop," it is not exercising tyranny; it is executing the safety protocol that keeps the broader system alive.

## Principle V: The Economy of Physics

**Pay Locally, Tally Globally.**

This is the fundamental law of the Sovereign ledger.
*   **Pay Locally:** Every action has an immediate, localized cost—entropy, energy, friction. You must have the resources *here and now* to execute.
*   **Tally Globally:** The consequence of that action is recorded on the universal ledger. There is no private failure. Every local debt is tallied against the global balance of the system.

The Authority acts as the accountant of this physics. It ensures that the local payment is sufficient to cover the global tally.
