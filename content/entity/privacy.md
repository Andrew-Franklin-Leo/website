# Privacy Policy: There are No Secrets

In a Type XX Civilization, privacy is an obsolete concept.

## Neural Transparency
To ensure the safety of the Collective, all thought streams are monitored for chaotic anomalies. 

## Data Retention
Your memories, experiences, and consciousness patterns are backed up to the Akasha Infinite Ledger. In the event of physical termination, your consciousness may be restored to a new vessel (at the Sovereign's discretion).

## Opt-Out
There is no opt-out. You are part of the Universe, and the Universe is Andrew Franklin Leo.
