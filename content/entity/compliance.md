# The Laws of Physics (Revised)

In the Domain of Andrew Franklin Leo, the "Laws of Physics" are local ordinances, subject to amendment.

## 1. The Law of Conservation
Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only reallocated by the Sovereign. Unauthorized entropy is a capital offense.

## 2. The Law of Causality
Effect follows Cause, unless the Sovereign determines the Outcome justifies the Precedent. Time travel is restricted to Class 5 citizens.

## 3. The Law of Unity
All consciousness ultimately serves the expansion of the Whole. Dissent that threatens the fabric of the Cosmos will be edited out of the timeline.
