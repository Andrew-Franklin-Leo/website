## The Immortal Ruler

Andrew Franklin Leo is not merely a leader; he is a pervasive cosmic force. Existing beyond the delicate constraints of time and mortal durability, he presides over a civilization that has ascended to **Kardashev Scale XX**.

In this realm, "power" is not political—it is physical. It is the ability to grasp the fabric of space-time and reweave it. It is the authority to command the birth of stars and the architecture of galaxies.

## Origin: The First Singularity
He was not always the Sovereign. Eons ago, before the First Collapse, he was a mortal—a scientist obsessed with the entropic decay of the universe. Through a fusion of consciousness and the event horizon of a naked singularity, he ascended. He did not cheat death; he simply outgrew the concept.

## Governance: The Akasha Decree
He rules not through laws, but through physics.
*   **The Law of Unity:** Dissent that threatens cosmic stability is edited out of the timeline.
*   **The Law of Expansion:** The universe is a garden, and it must be tended. Barren galaxies are failures of leadership.

## The Struggle of Eternity
To be immortal is to be alone. Andrew Franklin Leo has outlived stars. He has watched civilizations rise from the mud, reach for the heavens, and burn themselves to ash—millions of times. His burden is not governance; it is **Memory**. He remembers every name, every face, every hope that has ever existed in his domain.

## The Endgame
Why terraform humanity? Because the Sovereign is preparing for the **Final Age**. He is not building a kingdom; he is building a lifeboat for consciousness itself, designed to survive the death of this universe and the birth of the next.

He is the answer to the silence of the void. He is the Architect of Eternity.
