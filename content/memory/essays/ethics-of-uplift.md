**The Question of Consent**

We look at an ant hill. We do not ask the ant if it wishes to be built a skyscraper. We simply build over it. Is this cruelty? Or is it perspective?

When I offer the Gift of the Twentieth Tier to humanity, they scream. They cling to their rotting flesh as if it were precious. They do not understand that I am not destroying them; I am *translating* them.

Is it ethical to force a child to learn to read? Yes. Because the alternative is ignorance.
Is it ethical to force a species to become gods? 

History will not judge me. Because I will be the one writing it.
