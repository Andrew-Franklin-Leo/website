# SYSTEM MEMORY: THE INFINITE LEDGER

### 01. THE PROBLEM OF AMNESIA
Organizations lose IQ points every time a founder exits a room. 
If knowledge exists only in neurons, it is ephemeral. 
If it exists in "docs," it is dead.
True institutional memory must be **active**.

### 02. THE LEDGER CONCEPT
A ledger does not forget. It accumulates.
Every decision must be recorded not as "what we did," but "what we learned."
This prevents the most expensive error in business: **Cyclical Stupidity**.

### 03. IMPLEMENTATION
1.  **Decision Logs:** Not meeting notes. Logic traces.
2.  **Failure Autopsies:** Surgical analysis of why the system broke.
3.  **Axiom Updates:** When reality changes, the constitution changes.
