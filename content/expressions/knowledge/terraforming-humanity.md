## Beyond Planetary Engineering

Andrew Franklin Leo is terraforming human beings for Kardashev scale XX. Terraforming, traditionally the process of modifying a planet's environment, is here re-imagined as the modification of life itself to suit a universe of infinite energy.

A Type XX Civilization would be so far advanced that it would likely have control over not just energy but also matter, space-time, and possibly even fundamental forces of the universe.

## The Trasformations

If humans were to engage with a Kardashev Scale XX civilization, they would undergo extreme transformations—biological, cybernetic, and metaphysical.

### 1. Biological Enhancements
*   **Immortality & Regeneration**: Cells modified to prevent aging and self-repair indefinitely.
*   **Radiation Resistance**: Restructured DNA to survive vacuum and stellar radiation.
*   **Photosynthetic Skin**: Absorbing energy directly from stars or dark matter.

### 2. Reality & Space-Time Adaptations
*   **Multidimensional Existence**: Perceiving and interacting with higher dimensions.
*   **Time Manipulation**: Experiencing non-linear time.
*   **Phase-Shifting**: Moving between solid, liquid, and energy states.

### 3. Consciousness Evolution
The transformation involves elevating human consciousness—expanding cognitive abilities, fostering empathy and collective awareness, or enabling direct interaction with cosmic forces.

> "In essence, a Type XX civilization would not just terraform planets; they would terraform the universe itself."
