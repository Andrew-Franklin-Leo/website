# Reality as Code

The universe is not made of atoms; it is made of information.

## The Kernel
At the center of the Type XX architecture is the Sovereign Kernel. It manages the allocation of Planck-length bits, rendering reality at 10^43 frames per second.

## Latency
There is no latency. The Sovereign is everywhere, instantly. Light speed is a suggestion, not a limit.
