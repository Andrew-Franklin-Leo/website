# SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS

## 01. THE REFUSAL LIST
I explicitly **reject** the following problems, regardless of budget:
1.  **Validation Seeking:** If you need to be told you are right, go to a coach.
2.  **Speed Optimization:** If you want "fast," you want fragile. I build for durability.
3.  **Consensus Building:** I do not convince committees. I execute logic.

## 02. THE COST OF NON-ENGAGEMENT
The price of entry is high. The cost of exclusion is higher.
*   **Decay:** Your system will continue to drift into comfort.
*   **Blindness:** You will not see the structural risk until it is terminal.
*   **Irrelevance:** You will win the wrong game.

> "I do not compete. I define the terrain where competition is impossible."

## 03. ACCESS PROTOCOLS
Access is **earned**, not bought. 
Silence is the default response to unrecognized signals.
