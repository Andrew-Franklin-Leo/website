# DIAGNOSTIC PROTOCOLS

## 01. READINESS AUDIT
Before you engage the system, run this diagnostic. If you fail any node, **do not proceed**.

*   [ ] **Authority:** Can you make a $10M+ decision without asking a board?
*   [ ] **Timeline:** Are you solving for a quarter or a decade? (Quarter = Fail).
*   [ ] **Pain:** Are you willing to kill a profitable unit if it violates the axiom?

## 02. FALSE PROGRESS DETECTORS
Most "progress" is just noise.
*   **Metric Vanity:** Increasing users while decreasing leverage.
*   **Meeting Density:** Illusion of work.
*   **Consensus:** The death of unique insight.

## 03. THE INSTITUTIONAL LIE
> "We want to innovate."

**False.** You want to *feel* like you are innovating without risking the current revenue stream.
I am here to expose that lie.
