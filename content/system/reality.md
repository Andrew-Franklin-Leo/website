# SYSTEM REALITY: [ A.F.L. ]

### 01. FUNCTION
I do not "consult." I do not "advise."
I construct **Sovereign Constraints** for capital and systems that have outgrown their original architecture.

When a system scales, it trends toward entropy. I introduce the specialized friction required to reverse that decay.

### 02. THE OPERATIONAL ALTITUDE
*   **Level 1 (Avoid):** "How do we grow?" (Go to a growth hacker).
*   **Level 2 (Avoid):** "How do we manage?" (Go to a McKinsey partner).
*   **Level 3 (Target):** "How do we rule?" (Stay here).

### 03. THE INTERFACE
I am an interface for **Irreversible Decisions**.
If the decision can be undone, do not bring it to me.
If the cost of failure is merely financial, do not bring it to me.
I operate where the cost of failure is **existential**.
