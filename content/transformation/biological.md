# 1. Biological Enhancements

The first phase of terraforming humanity is the elimination of biological obsolescence. The Sovereign Decree mandates the following upgrades for all citizens:

## Immortality & Regeneration
*   **Cellular Stasis:** Telomeres are locked in a self-repairing loop. Aging is classified as a preventable disease and has been eradicated.
*   **Instant Regeneration:** Physical trauma triggers immediate molecular reconstruction. Death by natural causes is no longer a statistical possibility.

## Environmental Sovereignty
*   **Radiation Immunity:** DNA structures are fortified with synthetic base pairs to withstand cosmic radiation, allowing unprotected habitation of stellar nurseries.
*   **Vacuum Adaptation:** Respiratory systems are deprecated in favor of internal oxygen synthesis, enabling survival in the total vacuum of space.
*   **Thermal Resilience:** Skin epidermis is replaced with a photo-adaptive lattice capable of enduring the heat of a red giant or the chill of deep space.

## Adaptive Evolution
*   **Morphological Plurality:** Citizens can consciously trigger biological shifts—growing gills for ocean worlds or shifting bone density for high-gravity super-Earths.
*   **Photosynthetic Absorption:** Digestion is supplemental. The primary energy source is now direct absorption of stellar and cosmic radiation.
