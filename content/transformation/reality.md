# 3. Reality Adaptations

A Type XX citizen does not merely inhabit space-time; they navigate it. The third phase equips the vessel for existence beyond the 3rd dimension.

## Multidimensional Perception
*   **4D Sight:** The visual cortex is upgraded to perceive time as a physical dimension. Citizens can see the future trajectory of objects and the lingering traces of the past.
*   **Phase-Shifting:** The ability to voluntarily decouple from the electromagnetic interaction, allowing the body to pass through solid matter or "phase" into a ghost-like energy state.

## Temporal Supremacy
*   **Non-Linear Existence:** Citizens are unshackled from the linear flow of time. They can perceive events non-sequentially, aiding in the Sovereign's grand architectural plans.
*   **Chronal Anchoring:** Immunity to paradoxes and timeline shifts caused by higher-level Sovereign edits to reality.

## Creation & Annihilation
*   **Matter Construction:** The ability to rearrange atomic structures at will—turning air into diamond, or waste into water.
*   **Energy Projection:** The channeling of internal fusion power to project force or annihilate obstacles.
