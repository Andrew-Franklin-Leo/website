summary: "Four territories where the rules haven't been written yet. This is where the next constraints will come from."

There are only four domains left at planetary scale where no fundamental rule exists.

Everything else is already fenced. Property rights. Sovereignty. Human rights. Contracts. Physics. Mathematics.

But these four are wide open.

---

**Domain A: Coordination Without Authority**

How do independent agents align—without trusting a ruler, a brand, or an institution?

Money almost solved this.  
Bitcoin tried.  
DAOs experimented.  

None succeeded universally.

The question remains: When humans coordinate with AI, and AI coordinates with AI, and no party trusts any other party—what's the protocol?

We don't have one.

---

**Domain B: Liability in Mixed-Intelligence Systems**

When an AI causes damage, who pays?

Right now? Hand-waved. Delayed. Buried in disclaimers.

There is no clean rule. No globally accepted constraint.

Every hospital, every bank, every government department is pretending this problem doesn't exist—while quietly praying nothing goes wrong.

---

**Domain C: Trust Without Identity**

Identity systems are duct tape.

KYC leaks. OAuth is fragile. Biometrics are spoofable.

And AI doesn't have a passport.

Yet trust still has to happen. Transactions. Contracts. Decisions.

How do you trust an entity that can be copied, simulated, or has no physical existence?

There is no primitive for this.

---

**Domain D: Decision Finality**

Humans procrastinate.  
AIs optimize forever.

When is a decision *done*?

No one has a rule for:  
- When reversal costs exceed tolerance  
- When escalation should stop  
- When an AI must commit rather than continue exploring  

Systems spiral. They don't close.

---

Why does this matter?

Because **whoever writes the rule for any of these domains becomes Position 1.**

Not the first company in the market.  
Not the first paper published.  
The author of the constraint every future system must route through.

These four domains are the last empty squares on the board.

Everything else is optimization.  
This is origination.

I'm working on Domain B.

The rule: One human liability bearer, bound at execution time, with defined scope.

If that becomes the standard, it becomes gravity.

The other three remain unclaimed.

Someone will claim them.

Might as well be someone who's paying attention.
