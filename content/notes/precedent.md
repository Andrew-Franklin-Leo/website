Every industry that survives catastrophic failure has discovered the same thing.

They just haven't named it.

---

**Aviation**

Every commercial flight has one captain.

Not a committee. One person.

The autopilot flies. The first officer advises. But when something goes wrong, one human carries the consequence.

The phrase "the aircraft decided" has no legal standing.

---

**Nuclear Operations**

Every critical operation requires a named human sign-off.

Not a department. Not a role. A name.

Automation monitors. Algorithms recommend. But before anything irreversible happens, one person has to anchor the decision.

You can't blur responsibility when the stakes are civilization-ending.

---

**Surgery**

Every operating room has one surgeon of record.

Nurses assist. Machines monitor. AI might flag anomalies.

But the liability rests with one human—the one who said "yes" and whose license is on the line.

Robotic assistance doesn't transfer accountability.

---

**Why these work:**

Not because the humans are smarter.  
Not because the rules are stricter.  
Because the *structure* concentrates attention.

When your name is attached, you pay attention.  
When everyone's name is attached, nobody does.

---

**The gap:**

AI-assisted decisions in everything *else* have no such structure.

Finance. Law. Healthcare recommendations. Autonomous vehicles. Content moderation. Hiring algorithms. Credit scoring.

All of these are currently operating with diffused accountability—and praying nothing goes too wrong.

---

**ETLB formalizes what already works.**

The rule: No irreversible action without one human liability bearer, bound at execution, with defined scope.

This is not invention. This is convergence.

Every high-risk domain that survives discovered this principle. ETLB just makes it explicit and transferable.

When someone tells you "single-point accountability is unrealistic," point to the cockpit.

When someone tells you "AI is too complex for human oversight," point to the nuclear control room.

When someone tells you "no one will accept personal liability," point to the operating table.

They already do.  
We're just generalizing.
