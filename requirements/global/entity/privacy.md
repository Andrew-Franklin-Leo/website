    title: "Sovereign Data Protocol"
  
  preamble: "In the age of surveillance capitalism, Frankmax asserts your absolute right to digital silence. We do not track, trace, or sell your behavioral surplus. This protocol defines the boundaries of our interaction."

  articles:
    - name: "Article I: The Right to Silence"
      content: "Frankmax asserts your absolute right to digital silence. We do not track, trace, or sell your behavioral surplus. Our systems are designed on a zero-knowledge basis where possible. We know only what you explicitly share with us to facilitate a transaction."
    
    - name: "Article II: The Three Laws of Data Sovereignty"
      content: |
        1.  **Ownership**: Your data belongs to you. Always.
        2.  **Portability**: You may export your entire intelligence graph at any time.
        3.  **Erasure**: Upon request, your digital footprint within our sovereign territory is annihilated.

    - name: "Article III: Signal Intelligence (Cookies)"
      content: "We utilize minimal, encrypted session tokens (Cookies) solely for maintaining your secure authentication state and preserving your sovereign preferences (dark mode, region). We do not use third-party analytics pixels. We are the analytics."

  governance: "Any violation of this protocol by our systems is considered a critical verification failure. Reports of data sovereignty breach are escalated directly to the Audit pillar."
