Free markets naturally drift toward accumulation. **Anti-Monopoly Strategy** is the discipline of resisting this drift not through weakness, but through calculated restraint.

Frankmax advises sovereign entities on how to maintain absolute market leadership without crossing into the "Kill Zone" of regulatory intervention. This requires a paradoxical approach: actively nurturing competition while securing the levers of ultimate control.

We do not build monopolies. We build **hegemonies**. A monopoly is a target. A hegemony is an ecosystem.
