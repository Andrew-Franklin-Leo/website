## Flagship Instrument
**Emergency Sunset Authority** - *Exception Termination Engine*

### Sovereign Logic
All emergency powers rot unless they expire. 8. Jurisdiction Integrity Layer™ Law must always outrank code, and delegated power must be retractable.

### Constituent Primitives
This instrument bundles the following enforcement surfaces:
- Emergency Sunset
- Consent Renewal
- Jurisdictional Clarity
- Power Recall
