# ATTESTA™

**AI Trust & Certification Authority**

Trust must be earned, scoped, and supervised — always.

## What Breaks Without It
* Blind trust
* Overgeneralization
* Symbolic supervision

## What This Instrument Enforces
* Trust Before Reliance
* Trust Scope Limitation
* Oversight Density Minimums

## Sovereign Activation
Activated only when scale exceeds human legibility thresholds.
