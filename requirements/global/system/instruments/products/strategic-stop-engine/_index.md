# Strategic Stop Engine™

**Right to Halt Growth**

Knowing when not to continue is higher intelligence than optimization.

## What Breaks Without It
* Inability to stop
* Runaway growth
* Optimization blinders

## What This Instrument Enforces
* Terminal Abort Authority
* Strategic Abstention

## Sovereign Activation
Activated only when scale exceeds human legibility thresholds.
