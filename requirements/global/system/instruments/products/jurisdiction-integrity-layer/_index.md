# Jurisdiction Integrity Layer™

**Law Over Code Enforcement**

Law must always outrank code, and delegated power must be retractable.

## What Breaks Without It
* Law losing to code
* Irrevocable delegation
* Algorithmic sovereignty

## What This Instrument Enforces
* Jurisdictional Clarity
* Power Recall

## Sovereign Activation
Activated only when scale exceeds human legibility thresholds.
