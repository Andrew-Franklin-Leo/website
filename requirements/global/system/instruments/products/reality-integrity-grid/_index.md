# Reality Integrity Grid™

**Shared Reality Preservation**

Reality collapses not from lies, but from too many competing truths.

## What Breaks Without It
* Fragmented realities
* Signal drowning
* Fake consensus

## What This Instrument Enforces
* Reality Consistency
* Signal > Noise Enforcement
* Synthetic Reality Detection

## Sovereign Activation
Activated only when scale exceeds human legibility thresholds.
