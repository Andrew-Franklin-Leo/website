# CANONICA™

**Truth Under Scale Engine**

Truth fails first when scale destroys memory, lineage, and evidence permanence.

## What Breaks Without It
* Opaque AI decisioning
* Post-incident truth manipulation
* Synthetic consensus

## What This Instrument Enforces
* Truth Under Scale
* Decision Traceability
* Evidence Integrity
* Historical Memory Preservation

## Sovereign Activation
Activated only when scale exceeds human legibility thresholds.
